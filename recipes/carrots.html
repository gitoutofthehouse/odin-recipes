    <p>These roasted carrots utilize the parboiling technique that I talked about in my most recent video. 
    It's definitely one of my favorite techniques for roasting vegetables.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large carrots, cut into sticks</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Set a pot of water on medium-high and bring to boil. Add 2 large pinches of salt.</li>
        <li>Prep the carrots into large sticks. First, cut in half then into half again, and into carrot sticks.</li>
        <li>Add the carrots to the water and cook for 6 to 8 minutes. Turn the broiler on the oven.</li>
